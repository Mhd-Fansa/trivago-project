                <p>trivago Hotel Manager is the free platform for hoteliers to
                    manage their online presence on trivago. By providing the
                    tools and advice necessary to ensure glowing online profiles,
                    we help them to improve their hotels’ ranking and visibility
                    on trivago, thereby boosting business and bookings.</p>

                    class="headline">Direct Connect</span>
                <p>By signing up for Direct Connect, independent
                    hoteliers are able to display live rates and
                    availability directly in trivago hotel search results.
                    In addition to boosting booking volume and
                    strengthening the hotel brand, third party
                    booking site involvement is eliminated – saving
                    the hotelier commission costs.</p>

                <p>The Hotel Test was conceived to offer hotels as much comprehensive content for their trivago
                    profiles as possible. Hotel guests receive a cash bonus for filling out detailed surveys about the
                    hotel, its amenities and their experiences staying there, the results of which are aggregated to
                    create an analysis of the hotel’s performance. That’s what we call a win-win situation.</p>
